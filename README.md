# Coffee


These are the coffee codes, namely the post-processing of preliminary research for the perfect espresso.

To run the codes, one should create two catalogues:
- 'Data' (with .csv data of mass and pressure);
- 'Plots' (where all the plots will land into).

The draw_plots.py code plots masses and pressure vs time for each data sample separately.

The collective_plot.pt code plots all the samples together. The code takes all the data 
in the 'Data' catalogue, so the plot might be unreadable for too many samples.
